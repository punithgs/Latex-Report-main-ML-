\chapter{Problem Statement} Developing a robust sign language detection system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) involves several significant challenges. Acquiring a large and diverse dataset of sign language gestures is critical yet difficult, necessitating extensive preprocessing to normalize and annotate the data accurately. This process involves converting video frames into usable sequences and ensuring that the dataset reflects various sign languages, gestures, and nuances. Designing an efficient RNN architecture to capture the temporal dynamics of gestures is complex, demanding substantial computational resources and expertise in model fine-tuning. The RNN must be capable of handling the variability in gesture speed, style, and individual differences among users, which requires a sophisticated approach to model training and validation.

Ensuring real-time processing for practical use necessitates optimizing the model to balance accuracy and speed, making it capable of providing instantaneous feedback. Handling gesture ambiguity and context-dependent nuances further complicates this task, requiring advanced algorithmic solutions to accurately interpret and distinguish between similar gestures. Additionally, creating a user-friendly interface that is accessible to individuals with varying technical proficiency is essential. This interface must offer clear and immediate feedback and be adaptable to different devices and platforms. Developing robust evaluation metrics and conducting extensive real-world testing are crucial to ensure the system's reliability and accuracy, ultimately enhancing accessibility and inclusivity for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
