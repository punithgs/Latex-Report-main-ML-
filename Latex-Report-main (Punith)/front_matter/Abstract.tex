Sign language detection using machine learning involves capturing video data of individuals signing, then preprocessing the videos to isolate relevant features such as hand and body movements. Machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial features and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for temporal sequences, are trained on this data to recognize and interpret gestures. The recognized gestures are then translated into text or speech, with post-processing steps to ensure accuracy and context understanding. This system continuously improves through user feedback and additional training data to enhance performance and reliability.
